# File Structure 
The file are in the order that i use for myself following a specific rule. As such i will leave a explanation on how it was design in case you may want to try for yourself.

# Folders system and files rules
The files and folders are organized by numbers, since it is the way i use on the personal vault. 
As such, for each main field (Daily Notes, Projects, etc.) each start with 0?_ MainArea
This system will follow the the folders inside until it reaches a desired files with a main index. Below you will have a example of one of my notes.

06_Computation -> 06_1_Windows -> 06_1_1_Windows10 -> Windows10ConfigurationNote

Folder 06_Computation will have a index page since it have multiple folder inside: Windows, Linux, MAC. The second level 06_1_Windows will also have a index for all the windows notes

# Tags in use
On the templates you will find multiple tags as i use them not to create a specific connection to other files but to have a broad connection across all the files where it may have some relevance.
